# Mission To Mars

### Overview

Robin, a junior data scientist, does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday so she spends a lot of time visiting sites with news about space exploration, especially the mission to Mars. Robin wants to write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location. To help Robin, we have created a web application which scrapes new data every time the user tells it to with a click of a button. To further polish the web app, we have added images of Mars's four hemispheres using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape the images and their titles, MongoDB to store the scraped data, and a web application to display the data. 

The following websites were used to gather the data:

* NASA Mar's News Site: https://redplanetscience.com/
* JPL Space Images Featured Image: https://spaceimages-mars.com
* Mar's Facts: https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
* Hemispheres: https://marshemispheres.com/
